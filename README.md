# SECTION B
This Student Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to manage student records, course information, and academic grades. The system follows object-oriented principles with proper encapsulation through classes like Student, Course, and Grade, which extends Course to include scoring functionality. The StudentManager class serves as the core component, handling operations such as adding students, recording grades, calculating GPAs, and generating reports. The console-based StudentManagementApp provides an interactive interface for users to perform these operations seamlessly.

The application includes a robust suite of JUnit 4 tests that ensure code reliability and functionality. These unit tests comprehensively validate constructor methods, getter/setter operations, business logic for grade calculations, GPA computations, and edge cases like handling non-existent students or empty grade lists. The test suite demonstrates strong test coverage with focused tests for each class, ensuring that the grading system produces accurate letter grades (A-F) and corresponding grade points (4.0-0.0), while the GPA calculation correctly weights courses by their credit values.
